**XCP + Hush Voting Improvement Proposal**

CONST 1 human = 3 total possible votes

Hmm :thinking_face: , how does one publicly or/and privately prove he or she has a local node setup that has built reputation through time alive of node? If greater than X reputation, add 1 vote to USERID.

Challenge Scenario 1: A experienced guru decides to set up 10 nodes using one computer with 10 virtual machines. Each VM has its own wallet T and Z addresses. The individual decides it wants more than 3 votes total to use and control the outcome of the community ballot.

Challenge Scenario 2: A new user joins the community and decides to invest in the Hush community. He or she is new and doesn't want to wait to have his or her vote heard. It has no node, miner, or even enough hush to be considered a valuable asset to the community. This individual decides to use someone else's node to verify something that is not locally true. Therefore inserting a artificial vote into the community.

I am asking because of counterparty idea with votes. I haven't fig'd a way to make XCP useful for voting unless the voting is tied to verification. With ZKP we could prove of such possibly, but this avenue is way over my head at the moment. We still have to have a simple secure proof that proves the individual is a real person who is not abusing the system through voter manipulation. We could also integrate keybase.

For example, my thought processes so far are: 1 individual can have 1 vote for mining, 1 vote for the node, 1 vote for hush IF TADDR > X int. This would enable a community and stronger foundation for Hush to add on to through XCP and Hush protocols, plus each person would be rewarded from their effort of votes (i.e. IF 3 votes, it earns hush from mining, node relay, own custom apps, and investment without XCP). The Hush community then can use their votes to push forward a path we all seek. With XCP, we could even have lottos and other weird vending machine ideas too. Hush would be one of the first to obtain this with XCP.

If the logic is sound and the identiy cannot be manipulated, I would surely list myself publicly to obtain these votes, but the public information provided at start is enough to prove I am a real person. By affiliating or working with keybase, I could also 'opt' in to add my Keybase profile to the Hush XCP voter shares app. Keybase could only be an option for the sake of privacy.

On the other hand, another individual may want to vote, but not give away any public data. This is when the water becomes murky for me. I know US has public entities that represent the public state reps that votes for the publicly known President.

I figure, ZKP could be very useful for proving an identity if someone wants to support the Hush network without providing personal details, although this will create more challenge for the developer(s).
