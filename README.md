# HIPs - Hush Improvement Proposals

This is the repository for Hush Improvement Proposals, also known as "HIPs". People wishing to submit HIPs, first should propose their idea or document as a Pull Request on this repo and discuss on [Hush Discord](https://myhush.org/discord). After discussion and copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here, normally as a pull request merge. 

We are fairly liberal with approving HIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a HIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a HIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Hush users.
